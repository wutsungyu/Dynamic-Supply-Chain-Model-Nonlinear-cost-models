# Dynamic Supply Chain Model Nonlinear cost models
Dynamic Supply Chain Model (Nonlinear cost models)

There will be many different costs in the supply chain, and these costs are often estimated using linear cost models  

But this is not in line with real life, so this article will introduce three cost models that are closer to the real world.

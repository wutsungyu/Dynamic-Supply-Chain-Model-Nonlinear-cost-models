* Cost classification loss.

This function calculates the cost of using y_pred on y_true with cost-matrix cost-mat. It differ from traditional classification evaluation measures since measures such as accuracy asing the same cost to different errors, but that is not the real case in several real-world classification problems as they are example-dependent cost-sensitive in nature, where the costs due to misclassification vary between examples.
* Savings score.

This function calculates the savings cost of using y_pred on y_true with cost-matrix cost-mat, as the difference of y_pred and the cost_loss of a naive classification model.
